🛸 Spaceship Game & Multithreading Exercise

This project demonstrates Python multithreading through two practical examples — one focusing on file processing and another on a real-time 2D game.

⚙️ Part 1 — Video to Audio Conversion

🎬 In this part, a video file is converted into an audio file in two ways to compare performance:

Mode	Description	Average Time
🕒 Without Threading	Sequential conversion	~16 seconds
⚡ With Threading	Parallel conversion using multiple threads	~7 seconds

✅ This shows how threading improves performance in I/O-bound operations, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously.

🚀 Part 2 — Spaceship War Game

A simple 2D space shooter game built with the arcade library.

🎯 Features:

Control a spaceship and destroy enemies.

A separate thread (make_enemy) spawns new enemies every 3 seconds.

Background thread runs independently from the main game loop.

Game ends when the player loses all hearts.

🧠 Demonstrates threading in real-time applications — background events (enemy creation) happen without interrupting gameplay.

🧰 Technologies Used

🐍 Python 3

🎮 Arcade — for the game engine

🎧 MoviePy — for video/audio conversion

🧵 Threading — for concurrent execution

📊 Key Concepts

Performance comparison: single-thread vs multi-thread

Safe thread usage in both I/O and graphical programs

Real-time thread handling in a game environment

🕹️ How to Run
# Install dependencies
pip install arcade moviepy

# Run the video/audio conversion script
python convert.py

# Run the game
python game.py

🎥 Demo Preview

✨ In the conversion part, threading reduces total time from 16s → 7s.
🛸 In the game, new enemies appear every 3 seconds without freezing gameplay.
