# To-Do List App (PySide6 + SQLite)

A simple desktop To-Do List application built with **PySide6** (Qt for Python) and **SQLite**.  
You can add, edit, mark as done, and delete tasks. Each task can have a title, description, and time.

---

## ✨ Features
- Add new tasks with title, description, and time
- Mark tasks as done / undone
- Delete tasks
- Tasks marked as done are displayed first
- Tasks with priority are shown in red
- Data stored in an **SQLite** database (`todolist.db`)

---

## 🚀 Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- PySide6
- SQLite3 (comes with Python)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install PySide6

▶️ Run the app

Simply run:

python main.py


Make sure the file todolist.db is in the same folder as main.py.

📦 Build executable (Windows)

You can create a single .exe file with PyInstaller:

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "todolist.db;." main.py


The executable will be in the dist/ folder.
